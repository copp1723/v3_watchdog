# Phase 1 Progress Report - V3 Watchdog AI

This document summarizes the progress made during Phase 1 of the V3 Watchdog AI project, focusing on reliability and operational improvements.

## Containerization

### Completed:
- Created a Dockerfile based on python:3.9-slim for consistent environments
- Added proper file copying and dependency installation steps
- Set up Streamlit as the entrypoint with correct server configurations
- Added Docker Compose configuration with Redis for future caching
- Created .dockerignore to optimize Docker builds and reduce image size
- Updated README.md with comprehensive Docker usage instructions

### Benefits:
- Consistent development environment across all machines
- Simplified deployment process
- Supports Redis for future caching improvements
- Easier onboarding for new developers

## CI Workflow

### Completed:
- Added GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
- Set up Python 3.9 environment in CI
- Configured test execution with pytest
- Added Docker image building as part of CI
- Set up linting with flake8
- Added step-by-step CI process with proper fail-fast configuration

### Benefits:
- Automated testing for every PR and push to main
- Early detection of issues before merge
- Consistent code quality enforcement
- Automated Docker image building

## Validation System Refactoring

### Completed:
- Created abstract base classes for validators in new `base_validator.py` file
- Extracted common validator logic into BaseValidator, BaseRule, and BaseProfile
- Implemented inheritance hierarchy for ValidationRule and ValidationProfile
- Added ValidatorFactory for creating validator instances with proper dependency injection
- Refactored existing code to use the new base classes with minimal disruption
- Added proper interfaces for validator components to improve extensibility

### Benefits:
- Reduced code duplication
- Improved maintainability through inheritance
- Easier to extend with new validator types
- Better separation of concerns
- More testable code structure

## Next Steps

### Phase 2 Priorities

1. **Modularize Validation Logic** ✅
   - Break down the large validation_profile.py file into domain-specific modules
   - Create separate validators for financial, inventory, and customer data
   - Implement registry pattern for modular validator management

2. **Redis Caching Integration** ✅
   - Implement caching using Redis for file processing and validation results
   - Add cache invalidation strategies based on file content and processing rules
   - Track cache performance metrics in Sentry for visibility

3. **Audit Logging & Session Management** (Next priority)
   - Add comprehensive audit logging for all user actions
   - Implement secure session management with proper token handling
   - Create unit tests for authentication and authorization flows

4. **UI Enhancements**
   - Update ValidationService to use the new modular validator classes
   - Improve feedback during validation process with progress indicators
   - Add insights display optimizations for mobile devices

## Task Details

### Modularized Validation Logic
- Created BaseValidator, BaseRule interfaces for consistent validator architecture
- Implemented domain-specific validators for financial, inventory, and customer profiles
- Added ValidatorRegistry for dynamic discovery of validators
- Maintained backward compatibility through fallback mechanisms
- Added comprehensive unit tests to validate refactoring

### Redis Caching Implementation
- Created DataFrameCache class in src/utils/cache.py for Redis interaction
- Enhanced load_data() to check cache before parsing data
- Implemented caching after normalization for parsed DataFrames
- Added cache support for compute_lead_gross() and validate_data()
- Added Sentry instrumentation for tracking cache hits/misses
- Added unit and integration tests for cache functionality
- Created documentation in docs/redis_cache_implementation.md
