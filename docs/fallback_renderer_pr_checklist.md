# Fallback Renderer PR Review Checklist

## Code Quality

- [ ] Code follows PEP 8 style guidelines
- [ ] All functions and classes have docstrings
- [ ] Type hints are used consistently
- [ ] No hardcoded values or magic strings
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Thread safety is maintained for error tracking

## Functionality

- [ ] Error taxonomy covers all common failure scenarios
- [ ] User-friendly error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Error logging captures all necessary information
- [ ] Performance monitoring is implemented correctly
- [ ] Error rate tracking is thread-safe
- [ ] Integration with insight flow works as expected

## Testing

- [ ] Unit tests cover all error types
- [ ] Edge cases are tested (missing variables, unknown error codes)
- [ ] Integration tests with real dealership data pass
- [ ] Performance monitoring tests verify timing data
- [ ] Error rate tracking tests verify counting logic
- [ ] All tests pass in CI environment

## Documentation

- [ ] README or module docstring explains the purpose and usage
- [ ] Error taxonomy is documented with examples
- [ ] Performance monitoring features are documented
- [ ] Error rate tracking features are documented
- [ ] Integration test scenarios are explained
- [ ] Dependencies are listed with versions

## Performance

- [ ] Render time is reasonable (< 100ms)
- [ ] Memory usage is optimized
- [ ] Thread safety doesn't impact performance
- [ ] Logging doesn't cause performance issues

## Security

- [ ] No sensitive information in error messages
- [ ] Error details are properly sanitized
- [ ] Logging doesn't expose sensitive data
- [ ] Thread safety prevents race conditions

## Integration

- [ ] Works with existing insight flow
- [ ] Compatible with current logging system
- [ ] Error codes align with other system components
- [ ] Performance metrics can be collected by monitoring system

## Deployment

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Backward compatible with existing error handling
- [ ] Can be deployed without downtime
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards can be updated

## Review Questions

1. Does the error taxonomy cover all expected failure scenarios?
2. Are the error messages user-friendly and actionable?
3. Is the performance monitoring implementation efficient?
4. Does the error rate tracking provide useful insights?
5. Are the integration tests comprehensive enough?
6. Is the documentation clear and complete?
7. Are there any security concerns with the implementation?
8. Does the implementation integrate well with existing systems?
