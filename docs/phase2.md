# Phase 2 Implementation Plan

## Overview

Phase 2 of the V3 Watchdog AI project focuses on enhancing the platform with advanced features including audit logging, robust session management, and predictive forecasting capabilities. This document outlines the implementation plan, technical specifications, and development roadmap.

## Key Components

### 1. Audit Logging

The audit logging system provides comprehensive tracking of all system events, user actions, and data modifications to ensure accountability and support troubleshooting efforts.

#### Implementation Details

- **Logging Service**: A centralized logging service that captures events across all platform components
- **Event Structure**:
  ```json
  {
    "event_id": "uuid",
    "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
    "user_id": "string",
    "action": "string",
    "resource_type": "string",
    "resource_id": "string",
    "details": {},
    "ip_address": "string",
    "session_id": "string",
    "status": "success|failure",
    "error_details": "optional string"
  }
  ```
- **Log Levels**: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- **Retention Policy**: 90 days for standard logs, 1 year for security-related events
- **Encryption**: All audit logs are encrypted at rest and in transit

#### Integration Points

- Authentication events
- Data access and modifications
- Report generation and scheduling
- System configuration changes
- API requests and responses
- User management actions

### 2. Session Management

Enhanced session management provides secure and efficient handling of user sessions with advanced features to support multiple clients and improved security.

#### Implementation Details

- **Session Store**: Redis-based distributed session store
- **Session Structure**:
  ```json
  {
    "session_id": "uuid",
    "user_id": "string",
    "created_at": "ISO-8601",
    "expires_at": "ISO-8601",
    "last_activity": "ISO-8601",
    "ip_address": "string",
    "user_agent": "string",
    "permissions": ["string"],
    "auth_method": "string",
    "is_active": "boolean",
    "device_id": "string",
    "metadata": {}
  }
  ```
- **Timeout Settings**: 30-minute inactivity timeout, 8-hour max session lifetime
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Support for multiple active sessions per user
- **Rate Limiting**: IP-based and user-based rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- **Token Management**: JWT-based with refresh token rotation

#### Security Features

- CSRF protection
- Session invalidation on password change
- Anomaly detection for suspicious session activity
- Geolocation-based access control (optional)
- Device fingerprinting (optional)

### 3. Predictive Forecasting

The predictive forecasting module enables data-driven predictions and trend analysis to provide actionable business insights.

#### Implementation Details

- **Forecasting Engine**: Time-series based forecasting system with multiple algorithm support
- **Supported Algorithms**:
  - ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)
  - Prophet (Facebook's forecasting procedure)
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory neural networks)
- **Forecast Types**:
  - Sales forecasting (daily, weekly, monthly)
  - Inventory turnover prediction
  - Customer behavior patterns
  - Seasonal trend analysis
- **Model Training**: Automated training pipeline with cross-validation
- **Accuracy Metrics**: MAPE, MAE, RMSE tracking for model performance

#### Integration Points

- Dashboard visualizations
- Scheduled reports
- Anomaly detection
- Business recommendations
- Alert thresholds
