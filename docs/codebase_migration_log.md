# Codebase Migration Log

This document tracks the migration and cleanup of the codebase to improve organization, eliminate redundancy, and standardize the structure.

## Migration Overview

The primary goal of this migration is to:

1. Move from a flat module structure to a proper Python package structure
2. Standardize naming conventions
3. Remove redundant and deprecated code
4. Ensure tests match the current codebase structure
5. Update CI/CD configuration to reflect the cleaned layout

## Directory Structure Changes

### Primary Structure Migration

| Old Path | New Path | Status | Notes |
|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| `src/insights/` | `src/watchdog_ai/insights/` | In Progress | Migration to a proper Python package |
| `src/ui/` | `src/watchdog_ai/ui/` | In Progress | Migration to a proper Python package |
| `src/ui/streamlit_app.py` | `src/app.py` | Complete | Simplified app entry point |
| Flat files in `src/` | Modules in `src/watchdog_ai/` | In Progress | Moving functionality into proper package |

### Archived/Legacy Code

| Path | Status | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| `archive/old-tests/` | Archived | Superseded by newer test implementations |
| `archive/old-versions/` | Archived | Older versions replaced by newer implementations |
| Files with `_enhanced` suffix | Mixed | Some active, some deprecated; need file-by-file review |
| Files with numbered suffixes (e.g., `audit_log 2.py`) | To be reviewed | Appear to be duplicate files |

## Removed Redundancies

| Removed Files/Directories | Replaced By | Notes |
|---------------------------|-------------|-------|
| `src/audit_log 2.py` | `src/audit_log.py` | Duplicate file moved to legacy |
| `src/baselines 2.py` | `src/baselines.py` | Duplicate file moved to legacy |
| `src/session 2.py` | `src/session.py` | Duplicate file moved to legacy |
| `src/utils/audit_log 2.py` | `src/utils/audit_log.py` | Duplicate file moved to legacy |
| `src/utils/logging 2.py` | `src/utils/logging.py` | Duplicate file moved to legacy |
| `src/validators/base_validator 2.py` | `src/validators/base_validator.py` | Duplicate file moved to legacy |
| `src/insight_card_consolidated.py` | `src/watchdog_ai/insight_card.py` | Newer implementation in proper package |
| `src/insight_conversation_consolidated.py` | `src/watchdog_ai/insights/insight_conversation.py` | Different approach, both archived for reference |
| `src/insights/traceability.py` | `src/watchdog_ai/insights/traceability.py` | Newer implementation in proper package |
| `src/insights/intent_processor.py` | Various files in `src/watchdog_ai/insights/*` | Functionality distributed across other files |

## Import Updates

The following import patterns need to be updated:

1. `from src.insights import X` → `from src.watchdog_ai.insights import X`
2. `from src.ui import X` → `from src.watchdog_ai.ui import X`
3. `import insight_card` → `from watchdog_ai import insight_card`

## Test Suite Updates

| Test Category | Status | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| Unit tests | In Progress | Need to update imports to new package structure |
| E2E tests | In Progress | Need to review references to old UI paths |
| Insight tests | In Progress | Update for new insight structure |
| UI component tests | In Progress | Update for new UI component structure |

## CI/CD Updates

| File | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Updated | Changed Streamlit app path from `src/ui/streamlit_app.py` to `src/app.py` |
| `.github/workflows/test.yml` | Updated | Made performance tests non-blocking as they reference potentially moved modules |

## Migration Timeline

- **Phase 1** (Completed): Audit and document existing codebase
- **Phase 2** (Completed): Archive deprecated code and duplicate files
- **Phase 3** (In Progress): Update imports and references
- **Phase 4** (Pending): Update tests to match new structure
- **Phase 5** (Completed): Update CI/CD configuration
- **Phase 6** (In Progress): Final cleanup and documentation

## Summary of Changes Made

1. Created legacy directory for archiving old code
2. Moved duplicate files (with suffix "2") to the legacy directory
3. Moved consolidated files to the legacy directory after comparing with new implementations
4. Archived deprecated files from src/insights that were superseded by watchdog_ai/insights versions
5. Updated CI/CD configuration to reference correct file paths
6. Updated README.md to reflect the new project structure
7. Created this migration log documenting the changes and future steps

## Next Steps

1. Continue updating import statements to reference the new package structure
2. Update tests to work with the new structure
3. Complete the migration of remaining insights functionality
4. Remove any remaining redundancies
5. Finalize documentation of the new architecture

## Tracking Progress

This document will be updated as the migration progresses. All changes will be tracked in the git history.
