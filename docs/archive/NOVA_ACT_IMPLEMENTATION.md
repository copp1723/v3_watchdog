# Nova Act Integration Implementation

## Overview

The Nova Act Integration provides an automated data collection system for Watchdog AI, enabling zero-click data retrieval from dealer management systems. This implementation includes robust browser automation, secure credential management, 2FA handling, and seamless integration with the Watchdog AI data processing pipeline.

## Key Components Implemented

1. **NovaActConnector**: Core class that handles browser automation, login, and data collection
   - Supports multiple concurrent browser sessions
   - Implements comprehensive error handling and recovery
   - Handles various authentication methods including 2FA

2. **2FA Implementation**: Complete support for three authentication methods
   - SMS verification
   - Email verification
   - TOTP Authenticator apps
   - Fallback UI for manual intervention when needed

3. **Scheduling System**: Flexible scheduling for automated data collection
   - Daily, weekly, and monthly scheduling options
   - Custom scheduling parameters
   - Integration with the ReportScheduler system

4. **Watchdog Integration**: Seamless connection to the data processing pipeline
   - Automated upload of collected data
   - Integration with validation and processing systems
   - Session state management for UI updates

5. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite for ensuring system reliability
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for system interactions
   - Mock system for testing without actual browser automation

## Implementation Highlights

### Browser Automation with Playwright

The system uses Playwright for browser automation, which provides:
- Support for multiple browser types (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Headless and headful modes
- Automatic handling of downloads
- Robust selector systems for interacting with page elements
- Advanced navigation and network handling

### 2FA Implementation

Complete 2FA support with both automated and manual fallback options:
- SMS code detection and entry
- Email code retrieval and entry
- TOTP code generation for authenticator apps
- Screenshot-based manual intervention UI when automation fails

### Secure Credential Management

Enhanced credential management with multiple storage backends:
- AWS Secrets Manager integration
- HashiCorp Vault support
- Local encrypted storage (fallback)
- Automatic credential rotation

### Error Handling and Recovery

Robust error handling throughout the system:
- Automatic retries for transient failures
- Fallback to manual intervention when needed
- Comprehensive logging and metrics
- Health monitoring for vendor systems

### Upload Pipeline

Seamless integration with the Watchdog AI data processing pipeline:
- Automatic upload of collected reports
- Integration with data validation systems
- Column mapping and normalization
- Session state management for UI updates
