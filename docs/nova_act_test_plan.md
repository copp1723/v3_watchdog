# Nova Act Integration Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the Nova Act integration, focusing on CRM template navigation and report retrieval functionality.

## Test Environment Setup
- Mock testing environment using `/tmp/watchdog_nova_act_sync.log` for action logging
- Pytest framework with async support
- Isolated test fixtures for log file management

## Test Categories

### 1. Mock Testing (Completed ✓)
- [x] Basic login flow verification
- [x] Report navigation and download simulation
- [x] 2FA handling for different methods
- [x] Error case handling
- [x] Action logging verification

#### Mock Testing Results (2025-04-21)
- All mock tests passing successfully
- Logging system verified and working
- Test coverage includes:
  - DealerSocket template navigation and 2FA
  - VinSolutions template navigation and 2FA
  - Error handling for invalid vendors
  - No-2FA flow verification
  - Error indicator checking

#### Issues Resolved
- Fixed logging configuration to ensure proper log file creation
- Implemented robust log file cleanup between tests
- Added force=True to logging configuration to prevent handler conflicts

### 2. Integration Testing (Next Phase)
- [ ] Real CRM vendor API connectivity
- [ ] Actual credential validation
- [ ] Live 2FA process testing
- [ ] Real report download verification
- [ ] Performance metrics collection

### 3. End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Complete user flow testing
- [ ] Multiple vendor support verification
- [ ] Error recovery scenarios
- [ ] Rate limiting compliance
- [ ] Data integrity validation

## Test Cases

### Mock Tests (✓ Completed)

   - Tested missing credentials
   - Simulated failed login attempts
   - Tested network timeout simulation

4. Special Cases
   - Verified No 2FA requirement flow
   - Tested multiple report types
   - Validated different download formats
   - Confirmed session management

## Real Testing Plan

### Phase 1: Vendor API Integration (Next Steps)
1. Setup test accounts for each CRM vendor
   - Required: DealerSocket test account
   - Required: VinSolutions test account
   - Setup sandbox environment access
2. Implement real API connections
3. Test basic authentication
4. Verify rate limiting compliance

### Phase 2: 2FA Implementation
1. Test SMS verification
2. Implement email verification
3. Handle timeout scenarios
4. Verify security compliance

### Phase 3: Report Retrieval
1. Test different report types
2. Verify data formats
3. Validate download process
4. Check error handling

## Success Criteria
1. ✓ All mock tests passing with proper logging
2. Successful integration with at least two CRM vendors
3. Reliable 2FA handling
4. Consistent report retrieval
5. Proper error handling and recovery

## Monitoring and Validation
1. ✓ Log analysis for each test run
2. Performance metrics collection
3. Error rate monitoring
4. Success rate tracking

## Timeline
1. ✓ Mock Testing: Completed
2. Integration Testing: 2 weeks (Starting 2025-04-22)
3. End-to-End Testing: 2 weeks
4. Performance Testing: 1 week
5. Security Validation: 1 week

## Resources Required
1. Test CRM vendor accounts (Priority)
   - DealerSocket sandbox access
   - VinSolutions test environment
2. Development environment setup (Completed)
3. Test data sets
4. Monitoring tools
5. Documentation resources

## Risk Mitigation
1. Backup test accounts
2. Rate limiting compliance
3. Data security measures
4. Fallback mechanisms
5. Recovery procedures

## Documentation
