# Column Mapping Implementation Report

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Redis Caching Implementation
✅ **Status**: Completed

Redis caching was already implemented in `src/llm_engine.py` with the following features:
- Cache key generation based on column names
- TTL configuration (default 24 hours)
- Error handling for Redis connection failures
- Cache hit/miss statistics tracking
- Redis configuration through environment variables

### Task 2: Add DROP_UNMAPPED_COLUMNS Option
✅ **Status**: Completed

Implemented a new configuration option in `src/utils/config.py`:
```python
# Whether to automatically drop unmapped columns after clarification
DROP_UNMAPPED_COLUMNS = False  # Default to off
```

Added logic to `process_uploaded_file()` in `src/validators/validator_service.py` to drop unmapped columns when this option is enabled:
```python
# Handle dropping unmapped columns if configured
if DROP_UNMAPPED_COLUMNS:
    # Combine explicitly unmapped columns and ignored columns
    all_unmapped_cols = explicitly_unmapped.union(ignored_columns)
    # Only drop columns that exist in the DataFrame
    cols_to_drop = [col for col in all_unmapped_cols if col in df.columns]
    if cols_to_drop:
        logger.info(f"Dropping {len(cols_to_drop)} unmapped columns: {cols_to_drop}")
        df.drop(columns=cols_to_drop, inplace=True)
        summary["dropped_columns"] = cols_to_drop
```

Also added similar logic to the user confirmation part to handle dropping columns when users select "Unmapped" during clarification.

### Task 3: Updated Documentation
✅ **Status**: Completed

1. Updated `README.md` with:
   - Information about the column mapping system features
   - Configuration options for Redis caching and unmapped column dropping
   - Added to "Recent Updates" section

2. Updated `docs/deployment.md` with:
   - Environment variables for Redis configuration
   - Commands for monitoring and managing the cache
   - Documentation for the DROP_UNMAPPED_COLUMNS option

3. Created `docs/prompt_versions.md` to track prompt version history and changes, as recommended in the handoff document.

### Task 4: Added Tests
✅ **Status**: Completed

1. Fixed and enhanced existing Redis caching tests in `tests/unit/test_llm_engine.py`:
   - Test for cache key generation
   - Test for cache hit scenario
   - Test for cache miss scenario
   - Test for cache statistics
   - Test for cache clearing
   - Test for Redis failure fallback

2. Added a smoke test script `verify_column_mapping.py` to verify the column mapping functionality works correctly.

## Additional Notes

1. Redis caching was already implemented in the codebase, so we verified and documented the existing implementation.

2. The DROP_UNMAPPED_COLUMNS option was added as specified, with the default set to `False` to maintain backward compatibility.

3. We updated documentation to include information about both Redis caching and the new DROP_UNMAPPED_COLUMNS option.

4. The implementation was tested with unit tests and a smoke test to ensure it works correctly.

5. The prompt versioning documentation was created to track prompt changes as recommended.

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Staging**: The implementation is ready to be deployed to the staging environment for further testing.

2. **Functional Verification**: Run the full test suite in the staging environment to verify that the implementation works as expected with real data.

3. **Performance Monitoring**: Use AgentOps to monitor the performance of column mapping to assess the impact of Redis caching.

4. **User Feedback**: Collect feedback from users about the unmapped column dropping feature to determine if it should be enabled by default in future versions.
