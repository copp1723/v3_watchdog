# Adaptive Threshold Learning Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create a system that learns from feedback to dynamically adjust insight thresholds, making anomaly detection more accurate over time.

## Components

### 1. Core ThresholdLearner Class
- Base class for adaptive threshold learning
- Feedback-weighted learning algorithm
- Threshold prediction for new data

### 2. Specialized Learners
- InventoryAgingLearner: Specific to aging thresholds
- GrossMarginLearner: For profit margins
- LeadConversionLearner: For conversion rates

### 3. Integration Points
- Hook into InsightEngine pipeline
- Connect with feedback system
- Update LLM prompts

## Implementation Steps

1. Create Base Infrastructure
   - Create src/insights/adaptive.py
   - Implement ThresholdLearner base class
   - Add core statistical functions

2. Implement Inventory Aging Learner
   - Add InventoryAgingLearner class
   - Implement aging-specific algorithms
   - Add validation and error handling

3. Add Test Suite
   - Create tests/unit/test_adaptive.py
   - Add test fixtures and mocks
   - Test edge cases and error handling

4. Engine Integration
   - Update InsightEngine to use learners
   - Add threshold context to LLM prompts
   - Implement feedback processing

## Success Criteria
- Thresholds adapt based on feedback
- Improved anomaly detection accuracy
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clean integration with existing systems
