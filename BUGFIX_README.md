# Watchdog AI Bugfix

## Issue: "Error generating insight. Please try again."

This document explains the fix for the "Error generating insight" error that appears when trying to generate insights in the Watchdog AI application.

## Issue Analysis

When uploading a dataset and attempting to generate an insight with a query like "how many totals sales did lead source car gurus produce?", the app displays "Error generating insight. Please try again." The browser developer tools show a 500 Internal Server Error for a POST request to `/api/stlite-server/0/stream`.

### Root Causes

1. **Poor Error Handling**: The original code catches exceptions during insight generation but only displays a generic error message without any details.

2. **LLM Integration Issues**: The error might be related to:
   - API key issues (missing, invalid, or incorrectly loaded)
   - OpenAI version incompatibility (the codebase pins `openai==0.28` for compatibility)
   - Network connectivity problems
   - LLM response parsing errors

3. **Data Validation Issues**: 
   - The query references "lead source car gurus" and "total sales", which may not map to columns in the dataset
   - The validation context might be missing or malformed

## Solution Implemented

The fix addresses these issues through several improvements:

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added detailed error logging with full traceback
   - Improved error display to show more information about failures
   - Added debugging expander to display error details when issues occur

2. **Improved ConversationManager**:
   - Created a new `insight_conversation_enhanced.py` with a robust `generate_insight` implementation
   - Added better validation of session state and context
   - Improved error handling and logging throughout the LLM interaction process
   - Enhanced the mock response mode for testing without API dependencies

3. **Enhanced App Logic**:
   - Created an improved `app_enhanced.py` that uses the enhanced conversation manager
   - Added better validation of inputs and context before generating insights
   - Improved UI feedback when errors occur

4. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Added `setup_env.py` to easily configure OpenAI/Anthropic API keys
   - Added an option to toggle between mock and real API usage
   - Improved logging of environment settings on startup

## How to Apply the Fix

### Automatic Method

1. Run the fix script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x apply_fixes.sh
   ./apply_fixes.sh
   ```

2. Run the enhanced app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run src/app_enhanced.py
   ```

### Manual Method

1. Configure your environment:
   ```bash
   python setup_env.py --use-mock  # For testing with mock responses
   # OR
   python setup_env.py --use-api --api-key YOUR_API_KEY --provider openai  # For real API calls
   ```

2. Run the enhanced app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run src/app_enhanced.py
   ```

## Verifying the Fix

After applying the fix, upload your data file and try running a query like "how many totals sales did lead source car gurus produce?" 

- If using mock mode, you'll get a realistic mock response
- If using API mode with a valid key, you'll get a real AI-generated insight
- If errors still occur, they will now display detailed information about what went wrong

## Explanation of New Files

- `src/insight_conversation_enhanced.py`: Enhanced version of the conversation manager with better error handling
- `src/app_enhanced.py`: Enhanced version of the main app with improved error handling and UI
- `setup_env.py`: Tool to configure environment variables
- `apply_fixes.sh`: Shell script to automatically apply all fixes
- `BUGFIX_README.md`: This documentation file

## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. Check the console logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify your API key is valid if using real API mode
3. Try running in mock mode first to confirm the application works
4. Check that the uploaded data contains the expected columns
5. Examine the error details in the expanded debug section in the UI
