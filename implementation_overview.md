# Watchdog AI - Phase 0 Implementation

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the implementation for Phase 0 of the Watchdog AI project, focusing on delivering a minimally viable, stable core that proves the unique insight value to executive users.

## Implemented Tasks

### Task 1: Hardened Ingestion Pipeline
- **Enhanced Error Handling in trend_analysis.py**
  - Added robust date parsing with detailed error messages for invalid formats
  - Improved numeric parsing with informative error messages and examples of invalid values
  - Added proper exception handling and logging throughout analysis functions
  - Ensures failed parsing won't silently break analysis

- **Enhanced CSV/XLSX Support**
  - Added comprehensive file type validation and error messages
  - Implemented support for multiple encodings and delimiters for CSV files
  - Added detailed validation and feedback for both CSV and Excel file formats
  - Provides useful error messages for common problems like missing columns

- **Unit Tests**
  - Created tests for date and numeric parsing error cases
  - Added tests for file format detection and validation
  - Created tests for error messaging and handling of edge cases
  - Ensures robust behavior in real-world scenarios with imperfect data

### Task 2: Foundational Normalization System
- **Implemented Term Normalization System**
  - Created YAML-driven dictionary (normalization_rules.yml) for mapping term variants
  - Implemented entries for lead sources, personnel titles, vehicle types, and departments
  - Added support for case-insensitive matching and common variations
  - Designed for maintainability with clear categories and extensible structure

- **Developed Normalization Preprocessor**
  - Created term_normalizer.py for applying normalization rules
  - Integrated with the data upload pipeline via data_io.py
  - Added support for both column names and data values normalization
  - Implemented graceful handling of missing or invalid values

- **Unit Tests**
  - Created comprehensive tests in test_term_normalizer.py
  - Added tests for specific term normalization cases
  - Verified behavior with various capitalizations and variations
  - Ensured full end-to-end validation in test_data_upload.py

### Task 3: Integrated Sentry for Error Tracking
- **Set Up Sentry SDK**
  - Added Sentry SDK to requirements.txt
  - Implemented Sentry initialization in app.py
  - Added proper context and environment configuration
  - Created error filtering for sensitive information

- **Enhanced Error Reporting**
  - Added detailed context and tags to error reporting
  - Implemented fallback for development environments
  - Added user-friendly error UI with Sentry integration
  - Set up proper transaction monitoring

- **Unit Tests**
  - Created test_sentry_integration.py for validation
  - Added tests for initialization and configuration
  - Created tests for sensitive data filtering
  - Implemented a test error generator for manual verification

## Next Steps
1. **Testing in Production Environment**
   - Verify Sentry integration with a real DSN
   - Validate error tracking with real user scenarios
   - Confirm that critical errors are properly captured and reported

2. **Refine Error Messages**
   - Review all error messages for clarity and actionability
   - Ensure executives can understand error indications
   - Validate that error messages guide users to correct actions

3. **Documentation**
   - Document the data ingestion pipeline for developers
   - Create user documentation for handling file uploads
   - Add comments to configuration files for maintenance
